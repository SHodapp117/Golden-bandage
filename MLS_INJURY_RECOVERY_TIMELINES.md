## Detailed Breakdown by Injury Type

### 1. ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) Injuries

**Recovery Timeline:**
- **Median absence:** 240 days
- **Mean absence:** 246.5 days
- **Range:** 186-310 days
- **Return-to-play rate:** 77-95% (92.6% in elite UEFA players)

**Trends Over Time:**
- 2010-2015: 269.6 days average
- 2016-2021: 219.0 days average
- **Improvement:** ~50 days reduction in recovery time

- **29%** either don't return or return at lower level

---

### 6. General MLS Injury Statistics

**Most Common Injuries:**
1. Hamstring strains: 12.3%
2. Ankle sprains: 8.5%
3. Adductor strains: 7.6%

**Average Time Missed:**
- **Mean across all injuries:** 15.8 days

**Injury Severity Classification:**
- **Minor:** 4-7 days missed (42% of injuries)
- **Moderate:** 8-28 days missed (56% of injuries)
- **Major:** >28 days missed (2% of injuries)

## Return-to-Play Criteria (Evidence-Based)

### Physical Criteria
- ✅ Full range of motion restored
- ✅ No pain during sport-specific movements
- ✅ No swelling or effusion
- ✅ Equal bilateral strength (isokinetic testing)
- ✅ Completion of sport-specific training progressions

### Performance Benchmarks
- ✅ 90%+ limb symmetry index
- ✅ Ability to perform at maximum speed
- ✅ Successful completion of cutting/agility drills
- ✅ Psychological readiness assessment

### Post-Return Considerations
⚠️ **Increased injury risk in initial 2-4 weeks post-RTP**
⚠️ **Reduced performance capacity in first several matches**
⚠️ **Gradual return to full match minutes recommended**

## Important Notes for Clinical Use

### Data Reliability
✓ All data sourced from peer-reviewed journals and medical conferences
✓ MLS-specific data from official MLS Injury Surveillance Database
✓ Studies include 6-16 year longitudinal data sets
✓ Population: Professional/elite level soccer players

### Clinical Application Considerations
- Individual variation exists; these are population averages
- Recovery times reflect **absence from competition**, not complete healing
- Conservative approaches show increasing RTP times in recent years
- Re-injury prevention protocols extend initial recovery periods
- Player position, age, and injury history affect individual timelines

### Trends Observed (2010-2021)
- **Increasing RTP times** for soft tissue injuries (more conservative protocols)
- **Decreasing RTP times** for ACL injuries (improved surgical techniques)
- **Decreasing re-injury rates** across most injury types
- **Better long-term outcomes** with extended rehabilitation
