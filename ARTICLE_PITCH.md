# MLS Injury Crisis: Article Pitch

---

MLS injuries have more than doubled since 2015—from 411 to 1,018 per season, far outpacing league expansion. I built a dataset of 8,497 injuries spanning 2008-2025 to figure out why.

Three findings stood out:

**1. FieldTurf muscle injuries take 70% longer to recover** (74.6 vs 43.8 days on grass)
**2. 42.7% of injuries appear the day after matches** — more than during games themselves (30.7%)
**3. The Leagues Cup era (2023-2025) saw a 55% spike** in average annual injuries

**The piece:** ~2,500 words on what's driving MLS's injury crisis—fixture congestion, Leagues Cup scheduling, synthetic surfaces interacting with climate, and recovery gaps that show up 24-48 hours after matches. Data-driven, peer-reviewed, with transparent methodology.

The Seattle Sounders present an instructive case: remarkably healthy from 2015-2023 (just 15 injuries over 9 years), but when muscle injuries *did* occur on FieldTurf, recovery averaged 131.7 days—triple the league average. The pattern reversed in 2024-2025 (48 injuries), raising questions about whether their low injury count reflected superior training protocols or simply good fortune that eventually ran out.

**Visuals included:**
- Injury trends 2015-2025 (bar chart showing the doubling)
- Day-of-week pattern (Monday spike at 25.2%)
- Surface × climate interaction (Continental climate shows 98% longer recovery on turf)

All three visuals are publication-ready at 300 DPI.

**Dataset:** Available at github.com/SHodapp117/Golden-bandage for reproducibility.

**Key findings validated** against 10 peer-reviewed studies from MLS Injury Surveillance Database (2010-2021) and UEFA research.

Let me know if this angle works—happy to adjust focus, length, or add team-specific breakdowns.
